# Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Qodana Discussions

[Qodana Discussions](https://github.com/JetBrains/Qodana/discussions) aims to be an inclusive space that is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

For this to be the case, it is vital that we all follow a basic set of guidelines and most importantly adhere to the code of conduct. As such, please make sure you read this Code of Conduct and Basic Usage Guidelines in its entirety. This isn’t your regular License Agreement that you should scroll through and agree blindy. It’s here for a reason and also contains practical information.

## How to behave

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration, respect and empathy in your speech and actions. Remember, we have all been through different stages of learning when adopting technologies.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Disagreements on things are fine, argumentative behaviour or trolling are not.

## How not to behave

* Do *not* perform threats of violence or use violent language directed against another person.
* Do *not* make jokes of sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory nature, or use language of this nature.
* Do *not* post or display sexually explicit or violent material.
* Do *not* post or threaten to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Do *not* make personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Do *not* engage in sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes and sexual advances.
* Do *not* advocate for, or encourage, any of the above behavior.

## How to report issues

If someone is acting inappropriately or violating this Code of Conduct in any shape or form, and they are not receptive to your feedback or you prefer not to confront them, please get in touch with one of the Administrators. The main Administrators are Kateryna Shlyakhovetska ([@shkate](https://github.com/shkate)) and Viktor Tiulpin ([@tiulpin](https://github.com/tiulpin)).

## Basic Usage Guidelines
The influx of messages per day and the numerous channels can lead to a lot of noise and little value in the long run. If we all follow a set of guidelines, it can help make things more useful and bearable for everyone.

* Remember this is a Discussions for Qodana. If you have generic questions that are about a technology (which may or may not be used with Qodana), maybe it’s better to use another forum, such as StackOverflow.
* This Discussions is not an official support channel. It is a place where the community hang out along with some members of the JetBrains/Qodana team. For official support, please contact [qodana-support@jetbrains.com](mailto:qodana-support@jetbrains.com) or use [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=QD). Still, you can ask and share whatever bothers you and we will try to do something about it.
* Find the right channel to ask your question. There are channels for pretty much every topic. For a list of several primary channels, see [below](#Common+Channels).
* When you ask a question, be patient. Don’t repeat it. Or at least not immediately.
* Do not ping or mention someone directly to get your questions answered, specially project owners, whether the project is Qodana or other, unless they specifically indicate that you can.
* Don’t split messages into multiple ones. Ask it all in a single message.
* Use code blocks. Don’t paste code as plain text. GitHub supports Qodana markup. If the code you are pasting is longer than a few lines, use "Code or text snippet" available from + menu next to message input. Only first few lines will be displayed to all users and people interested in the code can expand your code to look into details.
* While it’s polite to say “Hi” or “I have a question” before asking something, it doesn’t scale and leads to noise. You can say hello in the same message you ask the question if you like.
* Using threads is not required, but do take into account that it does allow people to more easily follow conversations, especially those jumping in late.
* Use reactions to show gratitude as opposed to a message. It reduces the noise and gets the message across.
* Don’t use reactions to tell people they’re in the wrong place or asking the wrong question. If they’re on the wrong channel, point them to the right one. If their question is badly worded, help them correct it. Have empathy.
* Take into account cultural differences. As they say, what the British say isn’t what the British mean. Remember this both as the receiver and producer of messages.
* Use the `Random` category if you’re unsure about how to do something.

## Common Categories

This is a list of some of the most popular categories as well as a sample of the types of categories available.

* `Announcements`. Updates from Qodana team
* `Ideas`. Share ideas for new features
* `Q&A`. Ask the community for help.
* `Random`. For random things.
* `Show and tell`. Show off something you've made with Qodana.
