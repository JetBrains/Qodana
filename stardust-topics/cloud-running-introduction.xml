    <p>The basic entity in <a href="https://qodana.cloud">Qodana Cloud</a> is an organization. Every Qodana Cloud user
        creates and becomes an organization member. Later, they can create additional organizations. </p>
    <p>Each organization can contain several teams, where each team provides unified access to projects for its team
        members. If you run the <a href="pricing.md" anchor="pricing-linters-licenses">Ultimate and Ultimate Plus</a>
        linters, you can create the unlimited number of teams. If you use only the Community linters, you can create
        only one team in your organization.</p>
    <p>Each project contains results of inspection carried out by %product% over a specific codebase.</p>
