    <p>Organizations provide top-level structuring of all entities in <a href="https://qodana.cloud">Qodana Cloud</a>.
    Each organization is created on the basis of a specific JetBrains account. Depending on your choice, it will be either
        private or public.
        Each account in Qodana Cloud is based on the organization that becomes its default organization.
    </p>

    <p>You can navigate between organizations using the list in the left part of the Qodana Cloud UI.</p>
