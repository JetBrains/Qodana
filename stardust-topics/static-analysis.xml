    <p>%product% implements the static analysis mechanism to automatically analyze your codebase without your participation.
        This means that you just run %product% to inspect your code and expect recommendations on how you could improve
        your codebase. No other actions like running additional scripts, downloading external libraries, or any
        additional configuring is required.</p>

    <p>The second fact about static analysis says that your software can be explored by %product% without building and
        deploying your software because code inspection is carried out on the codebase basis. So, no other activities are
    required from this side either.</p>

    <p>Once the static analysis stage is complete, you can explore vulnerabilities and faults in your code and see exact
        lines where %product% detected imperfections. %product% is equipped with a multitude of
        <a href="code-inspections.xml">inspections</a> responsible for detecting particular problems.</p>

    <p>To sum up, static analysis mechanism of %product% is an efficient way for keeping your software quality under
        control. You can observe the list of currently <a href="linters.md">supported technologies</a>,
        but keep in mind that this list will be growing over time.</p>
