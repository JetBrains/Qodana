    <p>Each inspection is a set of conditions to check code, detect and correct abnormal fragments in it. Qodana
        inspections can find and highlight various problems, locate dead code, find probable bugs, spelling problems,
        and thus facilitate improving the overall code structure. Using inspections, Qodana implements its
        <a href="static-analysis.xml">static analysis</a> mechanism. You can visit the
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/inspectopedia/">Inspectopedia</a> website and learn more about the
        inspections used by %product%.
    </p>

    <p>All inspections are highly configurable, so you can configure:</p>

    <list>
        <li>What inspections to run for your codebase. There are lots of various inspections, so you can enable or
            disable them for some reasons.</li>
        <li>What directories and files to include in your code checking. If you feel that you do not need to inspect
            any file or group of files, you can exclude them from code analysis.</li>
        <li>How to configure and use <a href="qodana-yaml.md">inspection profiles</a>. You can use the preset combinations
            of inspections specified by inspection profiles aimed for solving specific tasks, or create your own profile
        aimed for your satisfying your unique needs.</li>
