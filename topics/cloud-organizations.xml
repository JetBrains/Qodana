    <!-- The Admin role should be specified here because there are several admin roles here -->
    <!-- This behavior needs to be supplied with screenshots -->
    <p>Organizations are a way of giving peer users access to your projects. Each organization can have several
        projects, and several users can be associated with them. Each %product_cloud% user can be a member of several
        organizations.</p>

    <!-- This description needs to be extended based on the answers from use-cases -->

    <p>During the registration, %product_cloud% will suggest you to become a member of the organization based on your Email domain.
        You can confirm this action.</p>

    <p>If the organization did not exist before, you can create it.</p>

    <p>You can also send a request for joining an existing organization.</p>

    <p>The <menupath>Organizations</menupath> tab of the <menupath>Settings</menupath> section contains a list of
        organizations your account is associated with.</p>

    <p>By default, <menupath>Your personal organization</menupath> is crated for each %product_cloud% account. This organization
    is unique for each account. This section also contains the list of other organizations associated with the account. </p>

    <chapter id="cloud-organizations-creating-new-organization" title="Creating new organizations">
        <p>To create a new organization, on the <menupath>Organizations</menupath> tab click the
            <menupath>+ Add new organization</menupath> link. This will open the dialog window to specify the
            organization name and its visibility outside the account.</p>

        <p>After creating, you can access this organization using the left sidebar of the %product_cloud% UI.</p>

        <p>If you have the <emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> role, you can create and delete organizations, and

        <p>To manage the members and visibility of the existing organization, on the <menupath>Organizations</menupath>
            tab click the <menupath>Manage members and visibility</menupath> link. Using the
            <menupath>Invite people to &lt;organization_name&gt;</menupath> window, you can:</p>
        <list>
            <li>Invite new users to this organization and assign their roles</li>
            <li>Change the roles of the existing users. For more information, see the <a href="cloud-user-roles.xml"/> section </li>
            <li>Remove users from the organization.</li>

<!--    <p>If you have a personal account, so you have the <emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> role, but the
        <emphasis>My organization</emphasis> company is automatically  assigned to your account, so you cannot
        configure it or add any other organizations.</p> -->
