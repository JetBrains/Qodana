    <!-- The Admin role should be specified here because there are several admin roles here -->
    <!-- This behavior needs to be supplied with screenshots -->
    <p>Organizations are a way for giving peer users the access to your projects and project groups based on the company
        parameter. Each organization can have several projects and project groups, and several users can be associated with it.
        Each %product% user can be a member of several organizations.</p>

    <!-- This description needs to be extended based on the answers from use-cases -->

    <p>During the registration, %product_cloud% will suggest you to become a member of the organization based on your Email domain.
        You can confirm this action.</p>

    <p>If the organization did not exist before, you can create it.</p>

    <p>You can also send a request for joining an existing organization.</p>

    <p>The <menupath>Organizations</menupath> tab of the <menupath>Settings</menupath> section contains a list of
        organizations your account is associated with.</p>

    <p>If you have the <emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> role in %product_cloud%, you can create and delete organizations.
        You can also manage members and visibility of the existing organizations:</p>

    <list>
        <li><a href="cloud-manage-members.xml">Manage members of your organization</a></li>
        <li><a href="cloud-manage-organization.xml">Modify the organization's name, description, and logo</a></li>
    </list>

    <p>If you have a personal account, so you have the <emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> role, but the
        <emphasis>My organization</emphasis> company is automatically  assigned to your account, so you cannot
        configure it or add any other organizations.</p>
