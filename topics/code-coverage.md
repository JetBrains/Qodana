[//]: # (title: Code coverage)

**Code coverage** uses generated reports to calculate code coverage inside a method, a class, and a file.  

<note>File code coverage is not available in case of the <a href="qodana-jvm.md"/> linter.</note>

This feature is available under the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus [licenses](pricing.md#pricing-linters-licenses) in the 
following linters:

## How it works

The predefined code coverage threshold in %product% is currently set to 50%.

Code coverage employs several inspections that are already included in the `qodana.recommended` and `qodana.starter` 
[default inspection profiles](inspection-profiles.md#Default+profiles), so you do not need to enable them:  

| Linter            | Employed inspection                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [](qodana-jvm.md) | [`JvmCoverageInspection`](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/inspectopedia/JvmCoverageInspection.html)  |
| [](qodana-js.md)  | [`JsCoverageInspection`](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/inspectopedia/JsCoverageInspection.html)    |
| [](qodana-php.md) | [`PhpCoverageInspection`](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/inspectopedia/PhpCoverageInspection.html)  |

Once the inspection is complete, reports are available in [%product% reports](html-report.md) and [JetBrains IDEs](#overview-code-coverage-reports).

### Code coverage calculation

%product% calculates code coverage based on the number of code lines containing logic with function, method, and class statements
being ignored. Here is the snippet containing comments on how it works: 

```javascript
function divide(a, b) { // Not analyzed by code coverage
  return a / b; // Analyzed by code coverage
}
module.exports = divide; // Analyzed by code coverage
```

## Prepare the project

<tip>You can find configuration examples on <a href="https://github.com/qodana/qodana-coverage/tree/main">GitHub</a>.</tip>

1. Configure a code coverage tool. While configuring [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), note that all files in coverage reports 
should have the relative paths inside the project. For example, if your codebase files are contained in the 
`<project-root>/src/` directory, then file paths in code coverage reports should be `src/<file-name>`.

2. If you run %product% [locally](Quick-start.xml), use your code coverage tool to generate the code coverage report. 
Save the report to the directory where %product% can read it. If you run %product% in your [GitHub](github.md) pipeline,  
configure the workflow as shown in the [](#run-code-coverage) section.

## Run code coverage
{id="run-code-coverage"}

<note>
You can run %product% over a single test coverage report generated by a single code coverage tool at a time.

### Fresh code

Fresh code is the code contained in a GitHub pull request. %product% can calculate fresh code coverage and display the results. 

<note>While working with fresh code, %product% cannot analyze coverage issues for missing coverage in methods, classes, and files.</note>

To enable the fresh code feature, in your [GitHub](github.md) workflow configure the PR-mode:

```yaml
name: Code coverage workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - 'releases/*'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Use Node.js 18.x
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 18.x

## Overview code coverage reports
{id="overview-code-coverage-reports"}

After you have [prepared the project](#Prepare+the+project) and [ran code coverage](#run-code-coverage), you can overview 
code coverage reports in [Qodana Cloud](#Qodana+Cloud) or using your [IDE](#IDE). 

### Qodana Cloud

You can find code coverage statistics in the upper-right corner of the [%product% report](html-report.md) UI. It also 
enumerates the inspections that were employed by the feature.

<img src="code-coverage-report-qodana.png" dark-src="code-coverage-report-qodana_dark.png" width="706" alt="Code coverage in Qodana Cloud" border-effect="line" animated="true"/>

### IDE

You can overview code coverage reports using IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, and PhpStorm IDEs starting from 
version 2023.2. This feature is available for reports retrieved from Qodana Cloud after linking, or reports from local storage.

<note>It is not available for XML-formatted reports generated by IntelliJ IDEA Code Coverage Agent and JaCoCo.</note>

#### Open reports from Qodana Cloud

<procedure>
<step>
<p>In your IDE, navigate to <menupath>Tools | Qodana | Log in to Qodana</menupath>.</p>
<img src="code-coverage-step-1.png" dark-src="code-coverage-step-1_dark.png" width="706" alt="The Log in to Qodana Cloud menu" border-effect="line"/>
</step>
<step><p>In the <menupath>Settings</menupath> dialog, click <menupath>Log in</menupath>.</p>
<img src="code-coverage-login-window.png" dark-src="code-coverage-login-window_dark.png" width="706" alt="The Settings window" border-effect="line"/>
<p>This will redirect you to the authentication page.</p>
</step>
<step>
    <p>In the <menupath>Settings</menupath> dialog, search for the project you would like to link with.</p>
<img src="code-coverage-login-linking-project.png" dark-src="code-coverage-login-linking-project_dark.png" width="706" alt="Linking with the project " border-effect="line"/>
</step>
</procedure>

#### Open a local coverage report

You can open a locally-based code coverage file in your IDE.

In your IDE, navigate to <menupath>Run | Show coverage data</menupath> and open the file containing the code coverage 
report. 

<img src="code-coverage-open-locally.png" dark-src="code-coverage-open-locally_dark.png" width="706" alt="The Choose Coverage Suite to Display dialog" border-effect="line"/>

In the <menupath>Coverage</menupath> tool window, you can overview the test coverage report. This report shows the 
percentage of the code that has been executed or covered by tests. 

<img src="code-coverage-coverage-window.png" dark-src="code-coverage-coverage-window_dark.png" width="706" alt="The Coverage tool window" border-effect="line" animated="true"/>

#### Overview the report

The IDE highlights the codebase test coverage using color marking. By default, the green color means
that a particular line was covered, and the red color means the uncovered line of code. 

<note>If you see that the code coverage results look incomplete, you probably need to reconfigure your
code coverage tool and generate a new code coverage report.</note>

<img src="code-coverage-report.png" dark-src="code-coverage-report_dark.png" width="706" alt="The coverage report overview" border-effect="line"/>

The report shows coverage for the lines that implement the logic of a method, function, or a class, but not for the function,
method, or class declaration. The image below shows that code coverage is not applicable to line 7, while line 8 is not 
covered.
