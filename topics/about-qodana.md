[//]: # (title: About Qodana)

[![official project](https://jb.gg/badges/official-flat-square.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

**Qodana** is a smart code quality platform by JetBrains. This powerful static analysis engine enables development teams
to automate code reviews, build quality gates, and enforce code quality guidelines enterprise-wide â€“ all within their
JetBrains ecosystems. The platform can be integrated into any CI/CD pipeline and can analyze code written in 60+ languages
including Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Kotlin, Python, Go, and C#.

## Basic components 

Qodana consists of these basic components:

* <a href="static-analysis.xml">Static analysis</a> mechanism of Qodana means automated analysis of your codebase. 
* <a href="linters.md">Linters</a> are the components that let you analyze your code, find duplicate 
functions and incompatible licenses.
* <a href="code-inspections.xml">Code inspections</a> are the linter components that immediately analyze your code for 
specific issues.

The diagram below shows how all these components are combined in Qodana.

The fourth essential component is [Qodana Cloud](cloud-about.xml) that aggregates Qodana [reports](html-report.md) and 
processes [license information](project-token.md).

<note>
You can employ %product% linters available under the 
<a href="pricing.md">Ultimate and Ultimate Plus</a> licenses only after you 
create a <a href="cloud-quickstart.md">Qodana Cloud account</a>.
</note>

## Qodana workflow

The diagram below provides an overview of a typical Qodana use-case.  

<img src="basic-workflow.png" dark-src="basic-workflow_dark.png" width="706" alt="Basic Qodana workflow"/>

This diagram describes several steps:

1. Set up Qodana using [available options](#Setting+up+Qodana).

2. Take all necessary configuration steps:

   * Configure an inspection profile as described in the [](qodana-yaml.md) section
   * Configure Docker images using the [](docker-image-configuration.xml) section
   * Explore integration options using the [](ci.md) section

3. <a href="inspect-your-code.xml">Inspect your codebase</a> using available linters and 
<a href="features.xml">features</a>. You can run Qodana either [locally or within a CI/CD pipeline](#Running+Qodana). 

    Inspection results are available in these forms:

   * <a href="qodana-sarif-output.md">JSON files</a> formatted according to the SARIF specification
   * <a href="ui-overview.md">Interactive HTML reports</a>

You can study inspection results for all your projects using [Qodana Cloud](cloud-about.xml).

4. Based on the inspection results, you can improve your code using your IDE, and run %product% again to track the 
progress.  

## Setting up Qodana

<include src="lib_qd.xml" include-id="qodana-deployment-options"/>

## Running Qodana

You can run %product% [locally](Quick-start.xml) in a standalone mode using a PC or a server. Alternatively, inspecting 
your code within a [CI/CD pipeline](ci.md) means that your code will be inspected by %product% as part of a 
building and/or deployment process.

## Qodana Cloud

[Qodana Cloud](https://qodana.cloud) is a cloud-based solution that helps you accumulate various Qodana reports and track the 
progress in your project(s) from a single point. To learn more about Qodana Cloud, you can study the 
[documentation](cloud-about.xml).

## Qodana playground

[Qodana Playground](https://qodana.teamcity.com/overview?mode=builds) is a sandbox environment that runs in TeamCity, a
cloud-based CI system developed by JetBrains. You can use it to see Qodana in action and try various options yourself.
