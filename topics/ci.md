[//]: # (title: Integration with CI systems)

Qodana [linters](linters.md) are packed into ready-to-use [Docker images](docker-images.md). They can be 
integrated into virtually any Continuous Integration (CI) system in a similar manner.

<include src="lib_qd.xml" include-id="whitelist-of-ip-addresses" use-filter="for-ci"/>

The Qodana UI can be part of the CI user interface in case your CI supports the UI extension. If it doesn't, you can
spin the Qodana UI on your own following the [guidelines](html-report.md).
