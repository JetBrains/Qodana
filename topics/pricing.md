## Qodana licensing: an overview

The Community license is free to use, though its functionality is limited only to the Community versions of Qodana 
linters. Furthermore, it lacks numerous helpful [features](features.topic) that are available in the paid versions and 
only offers a limited period for [data storage](#pricing-data-storage) in Qodana Cloud.

The trial versions of the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus licenses are limited by a 60-day trial period. After the trial 
license expires, you'll have to purchase either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license to continue using Qodana.

You can study the [%instance% Terms of Service](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/agreements/qodana/license/) on the JetBrains website. 

 ## Frequently asked questions

<!-- This needs to be grouped by licenses and Qodana Cloud -->

### What do I need to start using Qodana?
{id="faq-start-using-qodana"}

1. You can navigate to the [Subscription Options and Pricing](https://www.jetbrains.com/qodana/buy/) page on the JetBrains
website and select the subscription option you would like to use. 

If you choose the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus trial license, you will be redirected to the 
[onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) page of Qodana Cloud. This is also applicable for the Community license.

If you plan to purchase either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license, you’ll be redirected to the JetBrains account 
page for payment details. After the payment, you will be redirected to the [onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) page of 
Qodana Cloud.  

2. During the onboarding stage on the Qodana Cloud website, you’ll generate a public key that will be 
identified by %instance%, as well as a project token for uploading %instance% reports to your first project.
Although the Community license does not require a Qodana Cloud account, it will be more convenient to use Qodana Cloud
in this case too.

<note>The Community license provides restricted functionalities compared to the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses. See
<a anchor="license-comparison-matrix">the comparison matrix</a> for more details.</note>

### Can I try Qodana before buying a license?

Yes, you can choose either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus trial license and start using Qodana for a 60-day trial period. 
After 60 days, you’ll need to buy either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license to continue using Qodana in your projects.

### Will I be notified when the license trial period comes to an end?

Yes, you’ll be notified when the trial period expires.

After its expiry, you’ll need to buy either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license. Expired trial licenses cannot be extended.

### What are the EAP and trial licenses?

An EAP license is a license that gives you full access to Qodana until July 31, 2023. On August 1, 2023, all EAP 
licenses will expire, which means users will have to switch to a trial license.

A trial license is a time-limited version of either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license. Each trial license 
duration is limited to 60 days, after which this type of license is no longer valid and cannot be used further. To 
continue using %instance%, you’ll have to buy a full version of your license.

### What are %instance% linters and Qodana Cloud designed for?

Both %instance% linters and Qodana Cloud are essential parts of the product named %instance%. You can inspect your codebase
using %instance% linters, and you can use Qodana Cloud for managing your projects and licenses, as well as collecting
%instance% reports in a single place. For more details, see the [](cloud-use-cases.topic) page of the Qodana Cloud
documentation.

### Can I use %instance% linters without creating a Qodana Cloud account?

If you plan to use the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus licenses, you have to create an account at Qodana Cloud and accomplish
the [onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) stage. For more details, see [the first question](#faq-start-using-qodana) in
this section.

You can run %instance% linters available under the Community license without using Qodana Cloud, but there are no obstacles
to using Qodana Cloud in this case. 

### Do I need to provide payment details for a trial license?

No, you don’t have to provide any payment details until you decide to buy a license for either the Ultimate or Ultimate 
Plus version of Qodana, which you can do after the trial period ends.

### Can I switch between licenses?

Yes, you can switch one time between trial versions of the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses using your 
JetBrains Account.

You can also switch one time from the trial version of the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses to the Community license.
Once you convert your trial license to the Community license, the process is irreversible. Ensure you are making an 
informed decision. Remember that the Community license does not support all the 
[features](#Features+and+third-party+software+support) available in the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus subscriptions. 
If you wish to revert back to the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus subscription after conversion, you will need to initiate a 
paid subscription.

After the trial period has ended, this one-time limitation is shifted, and you can switch between subscription plans 
the unlimited number of times. In this case, however, all purchased subscriptions are not refunded.

### What are the license costs comprised of?

The total license cost is based on the number of active contributors. An active contributor is a person who commits 
to any number of Qodana Cloud projects during the latest 90 days, within the same organization, and under a single 
license. During the [onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) stage and while creating a new [project](cloud-projects.topic), Qodana 
Cloud requests your repository URL to calculate contributors. The minimal number of contributors used for licensing is 3 (three). 

The number of actual contributors is calculated based on the subscription plan. For example, using the monthly 
subscription, on the 1st day of the month you bought a license for 10 (ten) contributors. Within that same month, Qodana 
found that your project had 20 (twenty) active contributors. In this case, for the upcoming month the license costs would 
be recalculated for 20 (twenty) contributors. At the end of the second month, the license costs would be recalculated 
again based on the actual number of active contributors found within that month.

For more details, see the **Fees and Payments** section of the 
[%instance% Terms of Service](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/agreements/qodana/license/).

### What is the minimum number of contributors I can buy the license for?

You can buy a %instance% license for 3 (three) or more contributors.

### What do I need to know about subscription billing?

Here is the billing description taken from the 
[%instance% Terms of Service](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/agreements/qodana/license/): 

**Monthly Subscriptions** – At the beginning of each Subscription Period, You will specify the expected number of 
Active Contributors (3 or more). At the end of the Subscription Period, You will be charged Subscription fees according 
to Your Subscription Plan based on the number of Active Contributors that You determined. Qodana checks the actual 
number of Active Contributors at the end of every Subscription Period. If that number is higher than the number of 
Active Contributors that You specified for that Subscription Period, You will not be charged for overuse. However, the 
number of Active Contributors You specify for the next Subscription Period cannot be lower than the actual number from 
the preceding Subscription Period.

**Annual Subscriptions** – fees include upfront payment for a set number of active contributors
chosen by the customer, plus extra charges for additional active contributors beyond that limit during the
subscription period (excess usage).

- **Upfront payment** – Customer pays upfront for the annual subscription based
  on the expected monthly number of active contributors (3 or more) at the monthly fee per active
  contributor for each month of their subscription.
- **Overuse/excess usage** – Qodana monitors the number of active contributors each
  month. If the number of active contributors exceeds the customer's monthly limit, a subscription fee
  will be applied for each additional active contributor in the next months. Users will not be charged
  automatically; instead, they can purchase additional licenses either through the provided email link
  or within their JetBrains Account. If the user doesn’t pay for the extension of the subscription, we may suspend Qodana service for three
  months until the customer pays for the additional contributors. The subscription will be automatically
  reactivated three months after its suspension for the number of active contributors for which the
  customer paid (or when the customer extends their subscription), unless we exercise our right to
  terminate the Terms.

No refunds or credits will be issued if the number of active contributors during a month is lower than
the prepaid limit.

### Where does Qodana store all license information?

Qodana Cloud stores all information about your Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses. This explains why you need to

[helpful features](cloud-use-cases.topic).

### Which minimum steps do I need to perform in Qodana Cloud?

All the required steps are described in the [Quick start](cloud-quickstart.md) section of the Qodana Cloud documentation.

### Are there any restrictions on using the Community license?

No, you can use the Community version of Qodana in any open-source or proprietary projects.

### What is the difference between the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses?

Compared to the Ultimate license, the Ultimate Plus license provides the following additional features:

* [](license-audit.topic)
* [](taint-analysis.md)
* [](vulnerability-checker.md)

### Which licenses are integrated into CI/CD pipelines?

All %instance% licenses support integration with the CI/CD solutions described in the [](ci.md) section.
