## Qodana licensing: an overview

During the EAP (Early Access Program) stage, you can run Qodana with the built-in EAP 
licenses free of charge. However, the EAP period will expire on July 31, 2023, and it cannot be extended.

After July 31, 2023, you will have to switch either to a Community license or a trial license for the Ultimate or 
Ultimate Plus versions.

The Community license is free to use, though its functionality is limited only to the Community versions of Qodana 
linters. Furthermore, it lacks numerous helpful [features](features.xml) that are available in the paid versions and 
only offers a limited period for [data storage](#pricing-data-storage) in Qodana Cloud.

The trial versions of the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus licenses are limited by a 60-day trial period. After the trial 
license expires, you'll have to purchase either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license to continue using Qodana.

You can study the [%product% Terms of Service](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/agreements/qodana/license/) on the JetBrains website. 

 ## Frequently asked questions

<!-- This needs to be grouped by licenses and Qodana Cloud -->

### What do I need to start using Qodana?
{id="faq-start-using-qodana"}

1. You can navigate to the [Subscription Options and Pricing](https://www.jetbrains.com/qodana/buy/) page on the JetBrains
website and select the subscription option you would like to use. 

If you choose the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus trial license, you will be redirected to the 
[onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) page of Qodana Cloud. This is also applicable for the Community license.

If you plan to purchase either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license, you’ll be redirected to the JetBrains account 
page for payment details. After the payment, you will be redirected to the [onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) page of 
Qodana Cloud.  

2. During the onboarding stage on the Qodana Cloud website, you’ll generate a public key that will be 
identified by %product%, as well as a project token for uploading %product% reports to your first project.
Although the Community license does not require a Qodana Cloud account, it will be more convenient to use Qodana Cloud
in this case too.

<note>The Community license provides restricted functionalities compared to the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses. See
<a anchor="license-comparison-matrix">the comparison matrix</a> for more details.</note>

### Can I try Qodana before buying a license?

Yes, you can choose either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus trial license and start using Qodana for a 60-day trial period. 
After 60 days, you’ll need to buy either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license to continue using Qodana in your projects.

### Will I be notified when the license trial period comes to an end?

Yes, you’ll be notified when the trial period expires.

After its expiry, you’ll need to buy either the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus license. Expired trial licenses cannot be extended.

### What are the EAP and trial licenses?

An EAP license is a license that gives you full access to Qodana until July 31, 2023. On August 1, 2023, all EAP 
licenses will expire, which means users will have to switch to a trial license.

A trial license is a time-limited version of either the Ultimate or the Ultimate Plus license. Each trial license 
duration is limited to 60 days, after which this type of license is no longer valid and cannot be used further. To 
continue using %product%, you’ll have to buy a full version of your license.

### What are %product% linters and Qodana Cloud designed for?

Both %product% linters and Qodana Cloud are essential parts of the product named %product%. You can inspect your codebase
using %product% linters, and you can use Qodana Cloud for managing your projects and licenses, as well as collecting
%product% reports in a single place. For more details, see the [](cloud-use-cases.xml) page of the Qodana Cloud
documentation.

### Can I use %product% linters without creating a Qodana Cloud account?

If you plan to use the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus licenses, you have to create an account at Qodana Cloud and accomplish
the [onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) stage. For more details, see [the first question](#faq-start-using-qodana) in
this section.

You can run %product% linters available under the Community license without using Qodana Cloud, but there are no obstacles
to using Qodana Cloud in this case. 

### Do I need to provide payment details for a trial license?

No, you don’t have to provide any payment details until you decide to buy a license for either the Ultimate or Ultimate 
Plus version of Qodana, which you can do after the trial period ends.

### Can I switch between licenses?

Yes, you can switch one time between trial versions of the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses using your 
JetBrains Account.

You can also switch one time from the trial version of the Ultimate and Ultimate Plus licenses to the Community license.
Once you convert your trial license to the Community license, the process is irreversible. Ensure you are making an 
informed decision. Remember that the Community license does not support all the 
[features](#Features+and+third-party+software+support) available in the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus subscriptions. 
If you wish to revert back to the Ultimate or Ultimate Plus subscription after conversion, you will need to initiate a 
paid subscription.

After the trial period has ended, this one-time limitation is shifted, and you can switch between subscription plans 
the unlimited number of times. In this case, however, all purchased subscriptions are not refunded.

### What are the license costs comprised of?

The total license cost is based on the number of active contributors. An active contributor is a person who commits 
to any number of Qodana Cloud projects during the latest 90 days, within the same organization, and under a single 
license. During the [onboarding](cloud-onboarding.md) stage and while creating a new [project](cloud-projects.xml), Qodana 
Cloud requests your repository URL to calculate contributors. The minimal number of contributors used for licensing is 3 (three). 

The number of actual contributors is calculated based on the subscription plan. For example, using the monthly 
subscription, on the 1st day of the month you bought a license for 10 (ten) contributors. Within that same month, Qodana 
found that your project had 20 (twenty) active contributors. In this case, for the upcoming month the license costs would 
be recalculated for 20 (twenty) contributors. At the end of the second month, the license costs would be recalculated 
again based on the actual number of active contributors found within that month.

For more details, see the **Fees and Payments** section of the 
[%product% Terms of Service](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/agreements/qodana/license/).

### What is the minimum number of contributors I can buy the license for?

You can buy a %product% license for 3 (three) or more contributors.

### What do I need to know about subscription billing?

Here is the billing description taken from the 
[%product% Terms of Service](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/agreements/qodana/license/): 

**Monthly Subscriptions** – At the beginning of each Subscription Period, You will specify the expected number of 
Active Contributors (3 or more). At the end of the Subscription Period, You will be charged Subscription fees according 
to Your Subscription Plan based on the number of Active Contributors that You determined. Qodana checks the actual 
number of Active Contributors at the end of every Subscription Period. If that number is higher than the number of 
Active Contributors that You specified for that Subscription Period, You will not be charged for overuse. However, the 
number of Active Contributors You specify for the next Subscription Period cannot be lower than the actual number from 
the preceding Subscription Period.

**Annual Subscriptions** – Fees for annual Subscriptions are charged as a combination of upfront payment for a number 
of Active Contributors selected by You and additional charges for Active Contributors exceeding the prepaid number 
during the Subscription Period (overuse):

- **Prepayment** – At the beginning of Your annual Subscription, You will specify the expected monthly number of Active 
Contributors (3 or more). You will be charged upfront for the Subscription fee, which will be calculated based on the 
number of Active Contributors that You specified multiplied by the monthly fee per Active Contributor based on 
Your Subscription Plan per each month of Your Subscription.
- **Overuse** – Qodana will check the actual number of Active Contributors at the end of every calendar month. If the 
actual number of Active Contributors exceeds the monthly number of Active Contributors that You specified, You will be 
charged a Subscription fee for each Active Contributor exceeding the monthly number of prepaid Active Contributors. The 
invoice for the overuse will be issued at the end of every calendar quarter and at the end of Your Subscription period 
(unless the Subscription Period is renewed). If the number of actual Active Contributors during any month is lower than 
the number of prepaid Active Contributors, We will not refund or otherwise credit the difference.
