## Introduction

Studying Qodana reports generated by multiple Qodana instances can become a tedious task 
when your project is developed by several teams that work independently, and each team uses its own IT infrastructure 
and virtual private networks. Apparently, this situation calls for a centralized solution that would be able to gather
information about code quality across the project(s) in the real-time mode and display it in a consolidated and 
digestible form.

**Qodana Cloud** is a cloud-based solution that helps you see the progress in your project from the single point. 
And this is the basic difference between Qodana and Qodana Cloud: while Qodana analyzes your code and generates reports 
on-site, this information can then be forwarded to Qodana Cloud. 

## Qodana Cloud use-cases

Below is a short list of use-cases when Qodana Cloud comes in handy.

**You are a manager responsible for product quality.** 
In case you primary job is management rather than coding, you should know the answer to the "How things are going?" 
question at any time. You can track the development process using reports from version control systems, bug trackers, 
and during meetings. Still, monitoring of software quality is missing, and you can only refer to conclusions from your 
teamleads or architects. Looking at the code cannot help you in this case. Also, collecting information about quality 
code can be a tedious task. You can use Qodana to automate the quality assessment process, and Qodana Cloud will allow 
you to see the overall picture.

**You work for an outsourcing company that resells IT services.**
Your company may deal with lots of various projects from different fields, which makes it difficult to be 
expert in all of them. Oftentimes, software products are developed on the customers' side, but quality monitoring is 
still part of your work. Using Qodana Cloud as an aggregator of Qodana reports will definitely help you in this case. 

**Your company relies on open source software.** Modern software products often resort to open source libraries to 
perform specific tasks. This approach saves companies time and money. Unfortunately, nobody could assure you that their 
code is free of bugs, and their licenses will meet your needs. Also, you cannot control the process of open 
source development. Using Qodana on GitHub, you can monitor quality of open source software used in your project, and 
the License Audit linter will inform you about its licenses. But if your project uses tens or hundreds of free libraries, 
this becomes a challenging task. Using Qodana Cloud allows you to aggregate tons of reports under a single roof.

**Your company purchases software from third-party vendors.** In case your company buys software from the outside, you 
still need to make sure that its quality meets your needs. Using Qodana will give you detailed reports generated 
by tried-and-tested software from JetBrains, and Qodana Cloud will aggregate reports from all Qodana instances.

On the **Log in** page, you can create a 
<a href="https://account.jetbrains.com/login">JetBrains account</a>
or use the existing account instead. Once you complete this step, choose the account type, either **commercial** or

If you choose the commercial type of account, you will be able to create a business account or join the existing account 
of your company. If you plan to use Qodana Cloud for personal purposes, choose the personal account.

> Using a personal account, you will not be able to bind your personal account to a company or perform any actions on
> behalf of your company. Personal accounts are always associated with the **My organization** company, which cannot be
> changed.

## Overview a report

This image shows Qodana Cloud displays Qodana reports.

This report contains the following information (listed from top to bottom):

<!-- Is this really a commit hash? -->
<!-- Is it really a diagram of problems? -->

* Project name
* Project URL
* Branch name 
* Commit hash
* Date and time when the report was generated
* Bar chart reflects the dynamics in problems found during the last five code analyses. The rightmost bar displays the
latest inspection results.

## Creating projects and groups


## Grouping users and reports



## Thoughts from meetings
Project group:

Personal account and commercial accounts
And two types of users

I need to document all workflows based on the use-cases.

Projects should be separated by projects.  Group of projects can be used as well.
Projects or teams should be hierarchical. Not teams not projects

Reports are sent based on a token.

Groups will be used like Idea's group.

I need to document that admin users can create other admin users. But there are no editors here.

<!-- All organizations should be renamed to the commercial account-->
<!-- Add here how to bind organization name to the account-->
<!-- I think permissions need to be grouped into an ACL table-->
<!-- I need to clarify what projects and groups are-->
