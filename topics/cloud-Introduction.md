## Introduction

Studying Qodana reports generated by multiple Qodana instances can become a tedious task 
when your project is developed by several teams that work independently and each team uses its own IT infrastructure 
and virtual private networks. Apparently, this situation calls for a centralized solution that would be able to gather
information about code quality across the project(s) in the real-time mode and display it in a consolidated and handy
form.

**Qodana Cloud** is a cloud-based solution that helps you see the progress in your project from the single point. 
And this is the basic difference between Qodana and Qodana Cloud: while Qodana analyzes your code and generates reports 
on-site, this information can then be forwarded to Qodana Cloud. 

## How Qodana Cloud works

NEEDS TO BE DONE


## Thoughts from meetings
Project group:

Personal account and commercial accounts
And two types of users

I need to document all workflows

Personal has no organization. They won't be able to group projects together.

Organizations has wider management permissions.

Personal users and organizations should be split into two separate groups.

You cannot login and can only go for an invite. And the persons who already have accounts can do it.

Login from a corporate email account can be used.

Projects should be separated by projects.  Group of projects can be used as well.
Projects or teams should be hierarchical. Not teams not projects

Reports are sent based on a token.

Groups will be used like Idea's group.

I need to document that admin users can create other admin users. But there are no editors here.
