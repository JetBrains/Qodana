[//]: # (title: Introduction)

Obtaining and studying code analysis reports from multiple Qodana instances running on-site can become a  challenge if a
project consists of multiple teams working on multiple projects simultaneously, and each Qodana analysis session is
run by an individual CI/CD system configured for working in its individual VPN.

**Qodana Cloud** is a cloud-based solution that allows people involved in the code quality issues observe reports
aggregated from Qodana instances running on-site.

The basic difference between Qodana Cloud and Qodana is concluded in the fact that Qodana Cloud does not conduct
code analysis. Instead, it collects reports coming from Qodana instances and demonstrates the aggregated overall
results to a user.
