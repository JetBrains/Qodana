[//]: # (title: Qodana linters)

[![official project](https://jb.gg/badges/official-flat-square.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)


Qodana is more than a static analysis plugin/UI/CI linter. It is a platform that allows companies to perform multi-level evaluations of the quality of code they own, contract, or purchase.

First, it does help improve code without relying on an IDE, either on a local machine or a build server, and it is designed to be seamlessly integrated into CI/CD pipelines or delivered as a cloud service.

Second, on top of the IntelliJ Inspection functionality, Qodana is extending its number of linters to provide a complete Project Audit. 

Linters you can try right now:
* [](qodana-jvm.md): static analysis for Java and Kotlin for Server Side projects using the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate features
* [](qodana-jvm-community.md): static analysis for Java and Kotlin for Server Side projects using the IntelliJ IDEA Community features
* [](qodana-jvm-android.md): static analysis for Android projects
* [](qodana-php.md): static analysis for PHP projects
* [](qodana-python.md): static analysis for Python projects
* [](qodana-js.md): static analysis for JavaScript and TypeScript projects

The [](qodana-jvm.md), [](qodana-php.md), and [](qodana-js.md) linters let you verify compatibility of third-party 
licenses, see the [License audit](license-audit.xml) feature description for details.

To detect code duplicates across different projects, you can use the [Qodana Clone Finder](about-clone-finder.md) linter.

Check the linter you want to try and follow the guidelines!
