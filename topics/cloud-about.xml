    <p>In case you run %product% in multiple projects or repositories, you can find that it would be good to load and
        aggregate all inspection reports in a single place, especially if the codebase is distributed across several
        servers and virtual private networks and each team works independently. This is when a centralized solution for
        collecting and displaying report information from all %product% instances would come in handy.</p>

    <p><emphasis>%product_cloud%</emphasis> is a cloud-based solution that helps you accumulate various %product%
        reports and track the progress in your project(s) from a single point: %product% instances automatically forward
    inspection reports to %product_cloud% based on project tokens.</p>
