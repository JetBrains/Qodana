    <p>Studying %qd% reports generated by multiple %qd% instances can become a tedious task
        when your project is developed by several teams that work independently, and each team uses its own IT infrastructure
        and virtual private networks. Apparently, this situation calls for a centralized solution that would be able to gather
        information about code quality across the project(s) in the real-time mode and display it in a consolidated and
        digestible form.</p>

    <p><b>%product%</b> is a cloud-based solution that helps you see the progress in your project from the single point.
        And this is the basic difference between %qd% and %product%: while %qd% analyzes your code and generates reports
        on-site, this information can then be forwarded to %product%.</p>
