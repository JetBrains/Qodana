    <p>Studying reports generated by multiple %product% instances can become a tedious task
        when your project is developed by several teams that work independently, and each team uses its own IT
        infrastructure and virtual private networks. Apparently, this situation calls for a centralized solution that
        would be able to gather information about code quality across the project(s) in the real-time mode and display
        it in a consolidated and digestible form.</p>

    <p><emphasis>%product_cloud%</emphasis> is a cloud-based solution that helps you see the progress in your project
        from the single point. And this is the basic difference between %product% and %product_cloud%: while %product%
        analyzes your code and generates reports on-site, this information can then be forwarded to %product_cloud%.</p>
