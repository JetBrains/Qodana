The **Qodana GitHub app** is a great way to improve the code quality of your GitHub repository. It can be installed to specific repositories or whole organizations by an organization owner or a repository admin.  
Once you install the app to your repository, it starts monitoring all its pull requests.

While the Qodana GitHub app supports only public repositories, for private repositories use the [Qodana Linters GitHub action](qodana-github-action.md).

If there is a problem in your pull request, Qodana app will add a comment to each problematic line.
To get a deep summary, you can open the Qodana analytics results page.

Explore the Qodana results in this [pull request](https://github.com/JetBrains/qodana-examples/pull/2/checks?check_run_id=1776577456) to the `qodana-examples` repository.
