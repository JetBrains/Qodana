    <p>Each project contains several Qodana reports. </p>

    <p>Each report contains the result of a Qodana inspection.</p>

    <p>You can observe any report related to a specific project by clicking the diagram below the project description.
        Here, you can observe reports in the descending order, from the latest to previous reports. This diagram reflects the
        project evolution and dynamics in problems detected by %qd%. </p>

    <p>In case your user has the <b>Administrator</b> role, you can delete any report from the project. The deleted report can
        be recovered within 3 (three) months starting from the deletion date.</p>

    <note>
        In case a project contains two identical reports, the latest commit overwrites the preceding commit, so only the last
        commit is displayed in the report.
    </note>

    <p>In case two different tools forward data within a single commit to %product%, two reports will be merged into a
        single report. </p>
