Sometimes you need more info about what a specific inspection reports, or why it is a problem in your codebase. 
[Inspectopedia](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/inspectopedia/) provides details about inspections: descriptions, severity levels, languages covered, etc. 

You can use the table of contents to explore all available inspections:
