[//]: # (title: Qodana as a Service)

If you need static analysis as a standalone cloud service, we recommend using [TeamCity Cloud](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/cloud/) with the [Qodana runner](teamcity.md). After creating your TeamCity Cloud instance, contact us at [qodana-support@jetbrains.com](mailto:qodana-support@jetbrains.com).

To see Qodana in action on popular projects, use the [Qodana playground](https://qodana.teamcity.com). Although this code runs daily on millions of machines, you can still find a couple of things that could be done better. It doesn't necessarily mean the code is poorly composed; it means that the technologies evolve, the surroundings change, and we need to keep up.
