<link-summary>A repository key is a public part of an SSH key pair generated by Qodana Cloud during the 
onboarding stage that provides Qodana Cloud with secure read-only access to your repository and lets Qodana count 
contributors, which is required by our license agreement. </link-summary>

A repository key is a public part of an SSH key pair generated by Qodana Cloud during the 
[project setup](set-up-your-project.md) stage. When you create a new [project](cloud-projects.topic) in Qodana Cloud,
the organization wizard requires an SSH or HTTPS URL to your repository. After you provide such URL, Qodana Cloud generates 
and returns a repository key in response. You need to store this key on a repository level of your
version control system (VCS) as an SSH key, access key, or deploy key depending on a VCS. 

A repository key provides Qodana Cloud with secure read-only access to your repository and lets Qodana count contributors, 
which is required by our license agreement. 

<warning>We do not recommend to store the key on the account level.</warning>

This table provides links to the most popular VCS documentation pages explaining how you can save a repository 
key:
