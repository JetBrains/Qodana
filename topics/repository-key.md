A repository key is a public part of an SSH key pair generated by Qodana Cloud during the 
[onboarding stage](cloud-onboarding.md). When you create a new [organization](cloud-organizations.topic) in Qodana Cloud,
the organization creation wizard asks to provide an SSH URL to your repository. After you provide a URL, Qodana Cloud generates 
and returns a repository key that you can copy.

After generation, a repository key should provide Qodana Cloud secure read-only access to your repository and serve the 
[contributor counting](contributors.md) purposes. For these reasons, you need to save it on a repository level of your 
version control system (VCS). Without a public key, %product% cannot run properly.

<warning>Do not store the key on the account level, so that it cannot be shared by other repositories within your account.</warning>

You can apply a repository key after generating it for the VCSs mentioned in the table below:

| VCS and link to documentation   | Repository key naming in VCS | Notice                                                              |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Azure](%azure%)                | SSH key                      |                                                                     |
| [Bitbucket Cloud](%bitbucket%)  | Access Key                   | Start from section **Provide Bitbucket Cloud with your public key** |
| [GitHub](%github%)              | Deploy key                   | Start from step 2, skip the SSH key generation step                 |
| [GitLab CI/CD](%gitlab%)        | Deploy key                   |                                                                     |
| [Space Automation](%space%)     | SSH key                      | Start from step 2, skip the SSH key generation step                 |
