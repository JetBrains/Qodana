    <p>You can group several projects into a project group. Here are the basic advantages of using project groups:</p>

    <!-- What are the advantages of using project groups? -->
    <list>
        <li>It lets you combine several projects into a single group to provide a convenient way for navigation.</li>
        <li>It lets you share various projects between groups.</li>
    </list>

    <p>To create a project group, click the <menupath>Create project group</menupath> button. This will open the list of
        projects that can be grouped. On this page, select the projects you would like to group. </p>

    <!-- This needs to be finished -->
    <p>New projects are available in the <menupath>Project groups</menupath> section. To observe the projects that are
        associated to a specific group, click it. </p>

    <p>To modify a project group, click the <menupath>Modify</menupath> button of the specific project group. Here, you
        can modify the group name, and add or delete projects from this group. </p>

    <p>To delete the group, click the <menupath>Delete</menupath> button. This action will delete the group, and move
        all the projects that were previously related to that group back to the organization thus making them ungrouped. </p>
