[//]: # (title: Vulnerability checker)

Relying on third-party software in your projects can become a source of vulnerability. To prevent security issues arising
from external packages, you can inspect your project using the vulnerability checker tool available in the 
[](qodana-jvm.md), [](qodana-python.md), [](qodana-go.md), and [](qodana-js.md) (only `npm` packages) linters 
starting from version 2023.2. This tool is designed using the 
[Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/) (c) data to check Gradle, Maven, NPM and PyPI dependencies for known vulnerabilities 
and let you manage such cases by getting the information about vulnerable dependencies. Based on that, you can also take 
immediate action to address vulnerabilities by quickly migrating to a safe and stable version of the package without 
known vulnerability issues.

The vulnerability checker doesn't send information about packages to the JetBrains server in cleartext form.
It sends only hashed names of packages. We never log or process hashes we don't have in our database. Thus, we don't 
analyze your proprietary or confidential packages.

This feature is available under the Ultimate Plus [license](pricing.md) and its trial version and provides the following
%product% inspections: 

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Inspection</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>VulnerableLibrariesGlobal</code></td>
        <td>Check the project for vulnerable dependencies</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>VulnerableCodeUsagesInspection</code></td>
        <td>Check whether your JVM-based project uses vulnerable APIs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>GoVulnerableCodeUsages</code></td>
        <td>Check whether your Golang project uses vulnerable APIs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>NpmVulnerableApiCode</code></td>
        <td>Check whether your JavaScript project uses vulnerable APIs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>PyVulnerableApiCode</code></td>
        <td>Check whether your Python project uses vulnerable APIs</td>
    </tr>

</table>


## How it works

To inspect your code using the vulnerability checker, in the [`qodana.yaml`](qodana-yaml.md) file, enable inspections from the 
table above. For example, for the `VulnerableLibrariesGlobal` inspection it will be: 

<chunk id="package-checking-enable">

```yaml
include:
  - name: VulnerableLibrariesGlobal
```

</chunk>

After your project is inspected, you can update the packages containing vulnerabilities to versions where such 
vulnerabilities are fixed, or switch to alternative packages.
