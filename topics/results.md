Project analysis reports are available in several forms.

As a result of local analysis, they are contained in [JSON](qodana-sarif-output.md) format, and you can view them in 
the form of [web reports](ui-overview.md). 

To be able to collect reports and view them in a more convenient form, you can configure forwarding to 
[Qodana Cloud](cloud-overview-reports.topic), which is available from local runs and from running in [CI pipelines](ci.md).
